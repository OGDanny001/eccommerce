# LuxuryStore - Frontend & Backend Project

## Project Overview

Complete, modern e-commerce frontend built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with PHP backend foundation in place.

## Architecture

- **Structure**: Clean folder-based organization
- **Components**: Reusable navbar and footer (in `/components`)
- **Assets**: `/assets/css` (styles), `/assets/js` (app logic), `/assets/images`
- **Backend**: `/config` (db.php), `/includes` (header/footer), `/api` (API endpoints)
- **Pages**: Public, auth, user account (in `/user`), admin sections (in `/admin`)

## Paystack Integration Setup

To set up Paystack integration, follow these steps:

1. Create a Paystack account at https://paystack.com/
2. Get your API keys from the Paystack dashboard
3. In /api/verify-payment.php, replace 'sk_test_your_secret_key_here' with your secret key
4. In checkout.php, replace 'pk_test_your_public_key_here' with your public key
5. Update the currency in checkout.php if needed (default is 'NGN')

## Future Development Notes

1. Use a build tool (Vite/Webpack)
2. Add a templating engine or framework (React/Vue) if scaling
3. Implement admin dashboards
4. Implement address management for users
5. Add advanced order management (shipping, cancellation, refunds)
6. Add more payment gateways
